# Robot Simulator

Write a robot simulator.

A robot factory's test facility needs a program to verify robot movements.

The robots have three possible movements:

- turn right
- turn left
- advance

Robots are placed on a hypothetical infinite grid, facing a particular
direction (north, east, south, or west) at a set of {x,y} coordinates,
e.g., {3,8}, with coordinates increasing to the north and east.

The robot then receives a number of instructions, at which point the
testing facility verifies the robot's new position, and in which
direction it is pointing.

- The letter-string "RAALAL" means:
  - Turn right
  - Advance twice
  - Turn left
  - Advance once
  - Turn left yet again
- Say a robot starts at {7, 3} facing north. Then running this stream
  of instructions should leave it at {9, 4} facing west.

For learning resources and help with installation, refer to the
[Exercism help page][].

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [Leiningen][].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [Homebrew][], run the following command:

    brew install leiningen

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:
[Leiningen installation][].

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

    /path/to/hello-world
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
