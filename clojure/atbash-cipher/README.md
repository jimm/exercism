# Atbash Cipher

Create an implementation of the atbash cipher, an ancient encryption system created in the Middle East.

The Atbash cipher is a simple substitution cipher that relies on
transposing all the letters in the alphabet such that the resulting
alphabet is backwards. The first letter is replaced with the last
letter, the second with the second-last, and so on.

An Atbash cipher for the Latin alphabet would be as follows:

```plain
Plain:  abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Cipher: zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba
```

It is a very weak cipher because it only has one possible key, and it is
a simple monoalphabetic substitution cipher. However, this may not have
been an issue in the cipher's time.

Ciphertext is written out in groups of fixed length, the traditional group size
being 5 letters, and punctuation is excluded. This is to make it harder to guess
things based on word boundaries.

## Examples
- Encoding `test` gives `gvhg`
- Decoding `gvhg` gives `test`
- Decoding `gsvjf rxpyi ldmul cqfnk hlevi gsvoz abwlt` gives `The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.`

For learning resources and help with installation, refer to the
[Exercism help page][].

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [Leiningen][].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [Homebrew][], run the following command:

    brew install leiningen

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:
[Leiningen installation][].

[Leiningen installation]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen#installation

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

    /path/to/hello-world
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
