# Queen Attack

Write a program that positions two queens on a chess board and indicates whether or not they are positioned so that they can attack each other.

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same
row, column, or diagonal.

A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

So if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at
(5, 6), then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

```plain
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ W _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ B _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
```

You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other.
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces
share a diagonal.

For learning resources and help with installation, refer to the
[Exercism help page][].

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [Leiningen][].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [Homebrew][], run the following command:

    brew install leiningen

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:
[Leiningen installation][].

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

    /path/to/hello-world
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
