# Pascals Triangle

Write a program that computes Pascal's triangle up to a given number of rows.

In Pascal's Triangle each number is computed by adding the numbers to
the right and left of the current position in the previous row.

```plain
    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1
# ... etc
```

To run the tests provided, you will need to install [Leiningen][].

To install Leiningen on Mac OS X using [Homebrew][], run the following command:

    brew install leiningen

For help installing on Linux, Windows or without Homebrew see:
[Leiningen installation][].

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

    /path/to/hello-world
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
