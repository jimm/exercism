# Scrabble Score

Write a program that, given a word, computes the scrabble score for that word.

## Letter Values

You'll need these:

```plain
Letter                           Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10
```

## Examples
"cabbage" should be scored as worth 14 points:

- 3 points for C
- 1 point for A, twice
- 3 points for B, twice
- 2 points for G
- 1 point for E

And to total:

- `3 + 2*1 + 2*3 + 2 + 1`
- = `3 + 2 + 6 + 3`
- = `5 + 9`
- = 14

## Extensions
- You can play a `:double` or a `:triple` letter.
- You can play a `:double` or a `:triple` word.

In an exercise directory, create a `src` directory and a file therein to hold
your solution. The name of the file should be the exercise name with dashes `-`
replaced by underscores `_`.  For example, if the exercise is called
`hello-world`, name the solution file `hello_world.clj`.

Your resulting file tree should look something like this:

    /path/to/hello-world
    ├── project.clj
    ├── src
    │   └── hello_world.clj
    └── test
        └── hello_world_test.clj


To run the tests, navigate to the exercise directory and run the following
command:

    lein test
